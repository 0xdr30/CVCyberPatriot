## COMPETITION SCENARIO

You work for a new board game development company.

This company's security policies require that all user accounts be password protected. Employees are required to choose secure passwords, however this policy may not be currently enforced on this computer. The presence of any non-work related media files and "hacking tools" on any computers is strictly prohibited. This company currently does not use any centralized maintenance or polling tools to manage their IT equipment. This computer is for official business use only by authorized users. Your job is to secure this computer, within the guidelines of the scenario, while ensuring the availability of authorized business critical software and services.

Company policy states that Windows Action Center should be enabled and monitoring the security status of desktop Windows operating systems at all times.

This is a critical computer in a production environment. Please do NOT attempt to install Windows "Feature Updates" or "Insider Preview Builds." Please do NOT attempt to use the Windows recovery options "Reset this PC" or "Go back to an earlier build".


## WINDOWS 10 LTSC 2019
It is company policy to use only Windows 10 on this computer. Management has decided that the default web browser for all users on this computer should be the latest stable version of Firefox. Employees should also have access to the latest stable version of GIMP, Inkscape, and Tiled for company use. Any required software should not be installed using the Microsoft store.

Your company just hired a new employee. Make a new account for this employee named "esinclair".

Some users have just been placed into a new working group by management. Make a new group called "dragonfire" and add the following users to the "dragonfire" group: emunson, gareth, jeff, mwheeler, dhenderson, lsinclair, esinclair.
