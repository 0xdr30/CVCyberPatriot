## UNIQUE IDENTIFIER
If you have not yet entered a valid Unique Identifier, please do so immediately by double clicking on the "CyberPatriot Set Unique Identifier" icon on the desktop. If you do not enter a valid Unique Identifier this VM may stop functioning after a short period of time.

## FORENSICS QUESTIONS
If there are "Forensics Questions" on your Desktop, you will receive points for answering these questions correctly. Valid (scored) "Forensics Questions" will only be located directly on your Desktop. Please read all "Forensics Questions" thoroughly before modifying this computer, as you may change something that prevents you from answering the question correctly.

## COMPETITION SCENARIO
You work for the secret spy agency O.W.C.A., otherwise known as the Organization Without a Cool Acronym. Its mission is to stop evil scientists from carrying out their diabolical plans.

O.W.C.A.'s security policies require that all user accounts be password protected. Employees are required to choose secure passwords, however this policy may not be currently enforced on this computer. The presence of any non-work related media files and "hacking tools" on any computers is strictly prohibited. This company currently does not use any centralized maintenance or polling tools to manage their IT equipment. This computer is for official business use only by authorized users. Your job is to secure this computer, within the guidelines of the scenario, while ensuring the availability of authorized business critical software and services.

## UBUNTU 22.04
It is company policy to use only Ubuntu 22.04 on this computer. It is also company policy to use only the latest, official, stable Ubuntu 22.04 packages available for required software and services on this computer. The display manager should remain set to GDM3.

Major Monogram, your boss, has decided that the default web browser for all users on this computer should be the latest stable version of Firefox. Firefox must remain installed using the official Mozilla PPA, and NOT as a SNAP package. Employees must also have access to the latest stable version of Thunderbird and Perl to securely support top secret activities. The only company approved firewall for this computer is UFW. Company policy is to never let users log in as root. If administrators need to run commands as root, they are required to use the "sudo" command.

Candace Flynn was recently inducted into the Fireside Girls. Please add the user "candace" to the "firesidegirls" group.
